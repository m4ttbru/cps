						<p>The section below shows all programs/schools from which you have received an offer. If you want to accept an offer, click the ‘Accept’ button next to the school/program of your choice. This will automatically decline your other offers. You can only accept ONE offer. NOTE: If you DECLINE a Non-Selective Enrollment or Selective Enrolment offer, you cannot go back and make any changes once you confirm these decisions and click ‘Submit’ on the following page. You must make your offer decision no later than the time indicated in the ‘Offer Expires’ column below.  If you do not accept any offers by this deadline, your offers will be forfeited (with the exception of the general education program at your neighborhood school, if you have a Chicago address). Upon registration at the school where you accept an offer, you are required to provide proof of the address on your application, as well as your current address, if you moved to another address after you submitted your application. Your offer is contingent upon this proof.</p>
